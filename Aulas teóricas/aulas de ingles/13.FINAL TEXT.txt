    hello everyone, me marlon, who's been living for 20 long years, most of them in Blumenau, I had a good development in the area of ​​software development, counting a few years of study by senai and a few more in video leassons. I ended up getting interested in programming and even practiced and followed the news in my spare time.

    Since school, physics and mathematics have always been my strong point, some days my fun, I always liked to solve calculations, and consequently problems that made me break my head.

    Today, programming languages, in addition to being my day-to-day tools, are also one of my hobbies (the others are exercising and playing video games), and I intend not to give up (again).

    After completing the course, which has already added a lot to my curriculum, both in code and in finance, entrepreneurship and English. But you know what they say about when the programmer stops studying, right? well... don't stop. and maybe soon, starting my college studies and some bigger projects.

    Today I see many options within the programming area, such as game development and mobile applications, among which I am most interested and which ones grow the most or best exercise the logic and problem solving. The areas I plan to work-on in the future.
