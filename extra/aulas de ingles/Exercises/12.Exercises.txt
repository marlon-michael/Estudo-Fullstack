I could help you to study english last night
I can fix your computer for you tomorrow
You should go sleep for this night, you play a lot
He must have studied a lot to work in his area
They must have eaten before run the marathon

I couldn't fix your computer, it was very damaged
I can't learn this english rules, its too difficult
You mustn't eat all the cake alone
He wouldn't like this toy

Could i visit you tomorrow?
Can you help me with the english prhases this night?
Can my brother come together?
Could you drive when you were younger?
