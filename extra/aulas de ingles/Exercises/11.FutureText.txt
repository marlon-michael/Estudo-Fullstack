this weekend there's nothing new, I'm going to work this Saturday,
I will take the opportunity to improve my studies in the areas of programming in my free time.
And this Sunday I'll take the opportunity to rest, I'll only get out of bed to eat and I'll only stop eating if I go to sleep.
And despite all the work I want very soon to be able to make better use of my hard-earned money,
eating more fried foods and snacks, watching the releases of movies and series and going out on weekends.
