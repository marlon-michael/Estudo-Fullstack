exercise

there is a rat in my shoe-
there is a bug in my script
there are dogs in the street-
there are water in my glass
there are lava in the volcano

there isn't food in my dish
there is no salad in the table-
there is no seats in this car
there is no milk in the fridge-
there aren't correct sentences here

is there any olive on the pizza?
is there any ant in the anthill?
is there any computer in the class?
are there any juice to drink?
are there monkeys in the jungle?

there was water in my glass
there were cats in that house

there will be money in my wallet
