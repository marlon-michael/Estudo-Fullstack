	they spoke that was easier for a snake to smoke than Brazil to enter the war, inconvenient geermans, it happened at 1942, everything was going well until that moment, that atack from german forces in our own coast, was the fuse to put our contry into the war. the snake was smoking at that moment.
	when i was fighting in war in 1944 at monte castelo, italy, i couldn't guess such brutality that would be to come, i was there just following orders. At this years we can't deny nothing incoming from an higher degreee, at least, if you liked your life and reputation.
	this was one of the greatest battles our contry has ever fought, and i have got my orders, take that hill at any cost. we were supposed to start the attack at 6pm, but that day started earlier, i woke up at gunshot sounds, taking my rifle and running for the other soldiers.
	our batalion was attacking by the flanks, we reached the top of monte castelo first, we keep fighting all afternoon, in the end, looking ahead or behind, we could only see one thing in common... blood. at 5 and a half we reached the top of monte castelo and we expel all germans. at the end of the day, worn out and tired but alive, i could finally be coming home.
